          <p>
            Low‑latency routing with robust, redundant connectivity helps reduce slippage during high‑impact
            sessions. Orders are processed through a modern execution stack that prioritises deterministic
            performance and reliability, so your strategy behaves as intended under load.

          <p>
            Access institutional‑grade pricing on major pairs with spreads from 0.0 pips and competitive
            commissions. By separating spread and commission, your effective cost remains transparent, making it
            easier to optimise entries, exits and position sizing.
